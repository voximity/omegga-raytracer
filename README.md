Cursed raytracer for Omegga.

**WARNING:** Heavily unoptimized and impractical. Do not use for real purposes.
This is an experiment and no brick optimizations are done, and for large builds,
is very slow.

## Installation

`cd plugins`

`git clone git://github.com/voximity/omegga-raytracer.git`

## Usage

`!trace <yaw> <pitch>`

`!set <setting> <value>`

## Contributing

Feel free! If you wish to turn this experiment into something more practical, open a PR!
I will probably not take this experiment to that great an extreme, but you are welcome to
contribute.
